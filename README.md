# Free-Time
Programs I decide to write for their apparent usefulness or assumed difficulty.

# Wage Calculator (Taxes)
I wrote this Java program out of apparent usefulness. I tend to check my statements often to see 
how much I'm losing to taxes as well as to try and determine my next paycheck value before it
makes its way into my account at the end of the week. This program will do all the calculations
for me and show me everything I'm interested in. Currently works best with weekly pay periods.
